## Running the Application

From the project root:

1. **Install dependencies:** `npm install`
2. **Start the app:**
   - **CDN version:** `npm run server:cdn` — serves at `http://localhost:3000`
   - **NPM version:** `npm run server:npm` — runs Parcel and opens `http://localhost:3000`

Enter your access token and follow the on-screen instructions to initialize the SDK. For a step-by-step guide, see the [Sample App Tutorial](https://app.vidcast.io/share/b7c4ee45-9bb9-4a07-bae3-4c10d0239903).

## Features and Limitations

This demo showcases the following features:

- SDK initialization with an access token
- Agent login/logout
- Setting agent state
- Handling incoming calls
- Basic call controls (answer, decline, hold, mute, end)

**Important Limitations:**

- Only basic call control features are fully implemented
- Consult and transfer flows require manual destination entry and may not work as expected in all scenarios
- Some features may change in future releases

## Documentation

For more detailed information:

- Refer to the Webex Contact Center SDK documentation
- See the documentation provided with your SDK access for API details and implementation guidelines

## Project Structure

- `src/` — Single source for the app: `index.html`, `app.js`, `styles.css`. The HTML includes a placeholder `<!-- UNPKG_INJECT -->`; the CDN build injects unpkg script tags there.
- `dist/cdn/` — Generated by `npm run build:cdn` (unpkg scripts injected, app.js built for classic script). Served by `npm run server:cdn`.
- Root `package.json` — Holds all dependencies (`@webex/plugin-cc`, Parcel, etc.). Run `npm run server:npm` to start the app with Parcel from `src/`.
